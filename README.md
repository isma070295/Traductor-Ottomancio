# Traductor Ottomancio

Traductor Ottomancio is a unique translation program that converts text into the Ottomancio language, a special alphabet created by me. The translation engine uses a custom font and algorithm to convert each letter into its corresponding character.

## How to Use

1. Download the executable file below.
2. Open the program and paste your text into the "Original Text" box.
3. Click the "Translate" button to get the translated text and pronunciation as audio.
4. You can also click the "Play Audio" button to hear the translation read out loud again.

## Features
- Translates text into the Ottomancio alphabet.
- Audio output using pyttsx3 (speech synthesis).
- Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.

## Unique Design
The Ottomancio alphabet is a completely new and unique language system, with distinct mappings for each letter and number. The translation process is done with precision and care to ensure an accurate transformation of your text.
